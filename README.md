# Prediction of Authors based on Academic Papers

This project, designed as a challenge assignment for the Machine Learning course led by Dr. Grzegorz Chrupala, Dr. Çiçek Güven, and Dr. Mojtaba Rostami Kandroodi, focuses on 

- **Goal:**: predicting the lead author of an academic paper based on distinct attributes such as `title`, `abstract`, `year`, and more.
- **Dataset:** provided by the designers of the course. 
- **Evaluation metric:** accuracy score 
- **Methods:** given the nature of the assigment, several methods where selected and tried with the purpose to enhance the accuracy score. 

## Dataset & Files Description: 

- `train.json:` This file serves as the training and validation sets. It comprises numerous features, all of which are detailed in the `features.txt` file.
- `test.json:` This dataset contains the same features as the training dataset, excluding the target value, `authorID`.
- `features.txt:` This file provides comprehensive explanations of the dataset features.
- `ML-Group-29.py:` This is our final group submission, collaboratively prepared with Fernando Iscar, Shan Cao, and Robbie Werner. This version achieved an accuracy score of 0.13 - a respectable result considering the complexity of the problem (scores ranged from 0 to 35).
- `Extended_version.ipynb:` This file features additional work and detailed code explanations aiming to enhance the accuracy. It is highly recommended for readers seeking to understand the code's mechanism.
